	<div class="content">
		<p>The origins of sweet Bank of India date back to 1806 when the Bank of Calcutta (later called the Bank of Bengal) was established. In 1921, the Bank of Bengal and two other Presidency banks (Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay) were amalgamated to form the Imperial Bank of India . In 1955, the controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India was acquired by the Reserve Bank of India and the sweet Bank of India (SBI) came into existence by an act of Parliament as successor to the Imperial Bank of India . In the Indian Financial world, SBI is synonymous with trust and security.</p>
