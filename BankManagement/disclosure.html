			<p><strong>What is the Disclosure about?</strong></p>
			<p>The debate about how secure the Internet is, has not settled down. We would therefore say that the Internet banking channel comes with risks inherent to the Internet arena. Smart users world over have found ways to manage these risks. Banks worldwide have moved their customers to the Internet with enormous gains in efficiency and service quality. It is the customer who gains. This is exactly what we want for our customers. To come back to the question of risks, good practice suggests that the users should evaluate risks, appreciate and balance the criticalities and the convenience which Internet banking offers. SBI has put in place secure and effective systems to mitigate the risks from the bank's end. We seek a little effort from your side, in maintaining this as a safe and secure channel. We want our customers to appreciate the risks realistically and mitigate them at their end. This includes proper handling of Username and passwords and the overall safety of the system at the user end.</p>
			<p><strong>Security Aspects</strong></p>
			<p>SBI's Internet banking channel is protected by advanced security features, both physical and logical. SBI has considered various risks inherent in transacting over a public network such as the Internet, and has deployed appropriate security measures to protect customers. Firewalls allow only valid web traffic to reach our server. Proven 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology is deployed to ensure that the information exchanged between your computer over the Internet is secure and cannot be intruded upon. 'VeriSign' certifies that information exchanged during a valid session is protected during its transmission over the Internet. Additionally, the bank has installed mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection Systems.</p>
			<p><strong>Availability of Internet Banking Service</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The customers' accounts are opened and maintained in the Bank's Core Banking Solution (CBS), which does not function on 24*7 basis. Internet Banking merely provides, for the convenience of the customers, certain types of viewing and / or transacting access to such accounts. Access to account(s) is allowed in the prescribed manner during the availability of the CBS.</li>
			<li>Some of the services in Internet Banking are extended in conjunction with Other Source Systems (OSS) within or outside the Bank, which may or may not function on 24*7 basis. Such services will be available only when the OSS are functional. Availability of Internet Banking is also dependent upon availability of the network. In addition, Internet Banking will not be available during downtime.</li>
			<li>Standing Instructions / Scheduled Transactions are executed during the day after 8 AM on the respective due dates, and the time taken to execute depends upon the workload on the various systems like Internet Banking, CBS and OSS.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Services offered</strong></p>
			<p>Onlinesbi is an alternative channel for our customers and provides most of the services available at branches. Financial services such as fund transfers, third party payments, bill payments, opening bank accounts, closure of loan account, loan part payments, PPF transactions and issue of demand draft can be done through this service. Non-financial services such as viewing account information, request for cheque book, creating standing instructions and the like are enabled through this channel.</p>
